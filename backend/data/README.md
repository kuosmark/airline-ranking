# Aircraft reference

`mictronics-aircraft-types.json` is derived from `types.json` in the
[Mictronics aircraft database](https://github.com/Mictronics/aircraft-database)
full `indexedDB.zip` export. It maps ICAO type codes to the supplied readable names.
The initial import uses the 11 October 2026 export (database version 526).
Generic designators and non-aircraft entries are excluded. Names can describe a
family rather than the exact variant; upstream capitalization is preserved.

This adapted database is available under the
[Open Data Commons Attribution License](https://opendatacommons.org/licenses/by/1-0/).
The supplied licence is retained in `mictronics-LICENSE.txt`, and the application's
“How does it work?” section credits Mictronics. Keep both when updating.
`mictronics-aircraft.json` is derived from `aircrafts.json` in the same export.
Each lowercase ICAO24 address maps to `[typeCode, registration]`. Registrations
are uppercased with whitespace and hyphens removed. Only records with a type code
in the bundled type-name reference are retained. It contains no owner details.
The backend uses these records only when code/name matching fails, rejecting
conflicting nonempty registrations. Both files use the same attribution and licence.

## Updates

The backend packages the type names and the separate aircraft JSON file, so application use makes no reference-data requests.
The GitHub Actions **Update aircraft reference** workflow runs on the first
of each month at 07:23 UTC, or manually through **Run workflow**. Scheduling is
best-effort and becomes active only after the workflow is merged into main.

It downloads the full export, imports names and aircraft identities, and rejects malformed entries,
duplicate codes or ICAO24 addresses, a changed licence or removal of more than 5% of either reference.
Unchanged references produce no PR. Changed references run `npm run check`, then open or
update one PR on `codex/update-aircraft-types`. The owner reviews changed names and aircraft records
and approves merging; the workflow never merges or deploys. A failed update
leaves the deployed reference unchanged. Investigate failed Actions runs rather
than bypassing validation.

Repository Settings → Actions → General → Workflow permissions must allow
GitHub Actions to create pull requests. The workflow uses the built-in token;
no personal token is needed. GitHub may require a maintainer to select
**Approve workflows to run** on the generated PR. Confirm CI passes on the latest
revision before merging.

To reproduce an update locally:

```sh
curl --fail --location https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Mictronics/aircraft-database/main/indexedDB.zip --output /tmp/mictronics.zip
python3 scripts/update-aircraft-types.py /tmp/mictronics.zip
npm run check
```

Python 3 uses only its standard library. Review the JSON diff, particularly removals, registration/type reassignments and family-name changes. Do not infer additional aliases from similar names.
