# Contributing

Start with the [development instructions](docs/development.md). For a substantial change, open an issue describing the problem and proposed behavior before implementing it. Keep changes small and focused.

## Before submitting a pull request

- Use clear names, small functions and shallow control flow. Keep substantial Angular templates and component styles in separate files.
- Run `npm run check`. Tests use synthetic data and require no provider credentials.
- Add behavior-focused regression coverage for bugs where practical. Explain manual verification where automated coverage is unsuitable.
- Check UI changes at 320px, a typical mobile width and desktop. Verify wrapping, overflow, spacing and interactions, including keyboard use.
- Update documentation and any screenshots or diagrams made inaccurate by the change. Use sharp, readable images, descriptive alt text and clean framing; inspect rendered Markdown.
- Follow the [PR template](.github/pull_request_template.md), including a screenshot for visible changes. Never include credentials, `.env`, private information or generated build files.

Maintainers review changes and confirm checks before merging. UI changes also require the repository owner's inspection of the actual interface. See [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) for the repository's detailed working and review guidelines.
